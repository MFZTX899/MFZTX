**Developer:** Mohamad Faraj Fayad  
**[span_2](start_span)Specialization:** IT & Technical Systems[span_2](end_span)

### 📖 Project Context
[span_3](start_span)As an IT Specialist with a background in **CNC and Wood Fabrication**[span_3](end_span), I developed this engine to solve the problem of material inefficiency. [span_4](start_span)[span_5](start_span)It uses Python to parse G-Code from software like **Aspire and LightBurn**[span_4](end_span)[span_5](end_span) and calculates production efficiency.

### 🛠️ Key Features
* **G-Code Parsing:** Extracts coordinates from raw industrial files.
* **[span_6](start_span)Waste Analytics:** Implements the logic that helped me achieve a **15% waste reduction** in industrial settings[span_6](end_span).
* **[span_7](start_span)Diagnostics Logic:** Built with the same precision I used to maintain a **95% success rate** in mobile hardware repair[span_7](end_span).
